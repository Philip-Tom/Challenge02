        <h2>MY BOOTCAMP JOUNERY</h2>
        <p>
            I had in mind that UT BOOTCAMP will be one of the toughest days in my developer journey yet, i wasn't
            disppointed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because i like challenge and i'm to this challeng, learnig is what i love the most so yes iam up to the
            Challenge

        </p>
        <h2>CHALLENGE ACCEPTED</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, I would like to say, this is the first time that I’ve been with such a bright group of
            individuals that have an interest in tech with the same purpose as myself, without feeling like its a
            competition. Everyone here wants everyone else to succeed! The atmosphere is awesome. Most Bootcampers come
            from a self-learning background, and it’s amazing to see how far they’ve gotten on their own and in such
            very little time. I hear stories of their experiences, the obstacles they have faced and how they have
            overcome them dispite their level of expertise. Every day is about learning new things and getting help
            where I encounter issues. The adaptation is a bit lighter with these amazing individuals.
